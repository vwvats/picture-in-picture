# Picture in Picture
A 'Picture in Picture' app that allows users to take a streaming video and float it anywhere on their screen. 

## Objectives
I came to understand how complex asynchronous events work while making Picture in Picture. This app grabs a media stream on the user's instruction, populates a hidden video element with the selected stream, and finally pops a floating window on the click of the play button. This window plays the media stream selected by the user and can be docked anywhere on the screen. 

## Instructions
1 Click on the 'Choose' button to choose the screen to be popped off.
2 Naviagte back to the Picture in Picture page and click 'Play' to pop off the screen.
3 Enjoy! The mini screen can be resized as well as docked anywhere on your screen.
